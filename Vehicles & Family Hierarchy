Vehicles & Family Hierarchy(a) Car and Bus are different types of vehicles. Car has properties speed and no_of_passengers. The Bus also has the same properties. Both the vehicleâ€™s speed depends on its engine, and passengers depend on the number of seats given when a Car or a Bus object is created. You are assigned the task of comparing the two types of vehicles by their speed. Translate the scenario to a Java program by creating the classes and comparing the speed of two objects of the classes Bus and Car.
Solution:


class Car {
    private double speed;
    private int passengers;

    public Car(double enginePower, int seats) {
        this.speed = enginePower * 10;
        this.passengers = seats;
    }
    public double getSpeed() { return speed; }
    public int getPassengers() { return passengers; }
}

class Bus {
    private double speed;
    private int passengers;

    public Bus(double enginePower, int seats) {
        this.speed = enginePower * 5;
        this.passengers = seats;
    }
    public double getSpeed() { return speed; }
    public int getPassengers() { return passengers; }
}

public class VehicleCompare {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car(2.0, 4);
        Bus bus = new Bus(5.0, 40);

        System.out.printf("Car speed: %.1f, passengers: %d%n", car.getSpeed(), car.getPassengers());
        System.out.printf("Bus speed: %.1f, passengers: %d%n", bus.getSpeed(), bus.getPassengers());

        if (car.getSpeed() > bus.getSpeed()) {
            System.out.println("Car is faster.");
        } else if (car.getSpeed() < bus.getSpeed()) {
            System.out.println("Bus is faster.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Both have the same speed.");
        }
    }
}
